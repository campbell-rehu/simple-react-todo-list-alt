# Simple Todo List in React

## Introduction

This todo list application was built following the tutorial found [here](http://pankajparashar.com/posts/todo-app-react-js/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Advanced+Beginner+Challenge%3A+JavaScript+Day+18&utm_campaign=JS+Day+18).

## Thoughts

This todo list app uses a different method of incorporating React into the application. The script that is included in the `index.html` file is of `type="text/JSX"`.
